# Intro

A second example of how to automate a repeated section, where the loop is over different variables. This provides problems of its own, so a second example was necessary.

```{r}

N <- 500

df <- data.frame(Subsection = sample(LETTERS[1:3],N, replace = TRUE),
                 x = rnorm(N),
                 y = rnorm(N),
                 z = rnorm(N))

```


# The example

```{r, include = FALSE}

out <- NULL

for(i in names(df)[-1]){
  
  var <- i
  
  
  out <- c(out, knitr::knit_child("Child_RepeatedSection2.qmd"))
  
}



```

`r paste0(out,collapse = "\n")`
